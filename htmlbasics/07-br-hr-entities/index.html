        In a file so blank, our journey starts,
        With HTML, we craft the parts.
        CSS then paints with flair and grace,
        Giving soul and style to every space.

        JavaScript brings the logic in,
        Events and loops, the browser’s twin.
        Then TypeScript steps with structure tight,
        Errors caught before first byte.

        React mounts views in virtual trees,
        With Motion smooth like ocean breeze.
        Three.js draws with depth and light,
        A 3D world in canvas bright.

        Next.js serves with static might,
        SSG and SSR unite.
        Git records our every change,
        In GitHub Actions, builds arrange.

        Node.js runs server side,
        APIs and routes that never hide.
        Microservices take their shape,
        Scaling wide, no need to scrape.

        Pub/Sub whispers message flows,
        WebRTC — real-time it goes.
        Databases stand firm and deep,
        Where secrets, logs, and records sleep.

        MongoDB — no schema tight,
        PostgreSQL — with joins done right.
        Redis stores at lightning pace,
        In cache we trust, no time to waste.

        Nginx reverse-proxy king,
        Balancing loads like it’s nothing.
        Docker builds in boxed delight,
        Environments match by day or night.

        Kubernetes charts the course,
        Orchestrates with cloud-like force.
        Terraform writes the earth in code,
        Infrastructure in versioned load.

        Ansible plays with config cheer,
        Machines obey when it draws near.
        SonarQube checks if code is clean,
        Keeps the bugs out, sleek and lean.

        And Kafka streams the data queue,
        Pipelines fly as packets flew.
        From front to back, through stack so vast,
        The full-stack dev builds things to last.
