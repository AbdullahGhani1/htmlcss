        <p>
          Hotel BT (Est. 1995): In 1995, recognizing the growing popularity of
          beach destinations, the Magnolia Hotel Chain expanded with the opening
          of Hotel BT. Nestled along a pristine coastline, the resort boasted
          breathtaking ocean views, pristine sandy beaches, and a range of
          recreational activities. It soon became synonymous with relaxation and
          rejuvenation, attracting visitors from far and wide.

        <h2>Free Meals</h2>
        <p>
          It's always a bonus when a hotel offers complimentary meals to its
          guests. Free meals can add value to the overall experience and help
          guests save on dining expenses during their stay. Whether it's a
          complimentary breakfast, lunch, or dinner, having access to free meals
          can be convenient and appreciated by guests. It allows them to start

          option without having to go out or spend extra money. Free meals can
